I am a researcher who studies how mathematics can be used to understand questions in medicine and the life sciences. I also care a lot about sharing new research with the public in a clear and engaging way. To do this, I create games and projects that are always free to play and never include ads. I want them to be a fun way for people to explore science. If you choose to support me, your donation will help me spend more time on these projects and add new features that make them even better.
